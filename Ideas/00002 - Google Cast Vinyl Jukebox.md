
00002 - Google Cast Vinyl Jukebox
=================================

Motivation
----------

People love vinyl. People love play-on-demand music. Why not combine the two?



Current State
-------------

It's just an idea, and it goes something like this:

 - Create a machine that can handle and play delicate records on demand. This is an old technology so it should be easy.
 - Design it to store as many records as physically possible, and catalog those in a database.
 - Control the machine with a network-enabled microcontroller (Raspberry Pi should be the easiest to get going with).
 - Program the microcontroller to conform to the Google Cast standard
 - Program the microcontroller to parse song play requests from music apps (custom app?) and play records accordingly



Advantages
----------

Dude this would be so awesome XD



Disadvantages
-------------

Probably very expensive and breakable. Also people will get disappointed when their song isn't available if we allow arbitrary apps to cast.
